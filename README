A simple example on how to split up your
Model, view and controller.

As your can see, all you need to do is to
require (or in my case require_relative since
I'm using ruby 1.9.2) in your application file
(mine is called multitest.rb).

Both require and require_relative should work 
well!.

This is useful when making apps with more code 
that can get too hard to handle in one file
(you usually write everything in one file 
using camping).

That is all!
